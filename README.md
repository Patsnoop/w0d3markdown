## Hello! This project is something I drew up in a couple of minutes for this assignment. It is always good to brush up on the **basics** while learning more difficult concepts so that you don't forget where you started. 



# Project Introduction
This project is a simple loop creator (repeating process) that runs through a list (set of values) and adds up the value of an accumulator (starting number) until it reaches a certain value and then will not add any more, no matter how long the list is.

# Features
An accumulator, list, for loop with if and else statements

# Setup Instructions
For the set up, you can choose the value of x, the length and numbers in the list, and how high you want the value to count.

# Usage Guidelines
This is a **simple** counting tool to demonstrate how coding works for *beginners*.

# Project Description
This project is for anyone looking for the basics of **for** loops. This is a very simple project, with basic outlines, and will help those understand how it works.

# Caveats & Warnings
The following are things that might create an issue:
* Leaving an empty list
  * This would result in no loop being available
* Not setting *x* to a value (has to be a number in order for this program to run)
* Leaving out the else statement
* Not **calling** the function so the program has nothing to run
